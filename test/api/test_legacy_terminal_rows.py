"""Legacy terminal rows through the real retrieval path (cond-0173, B4).

A historical row whose stored lifecycle is ``unknown-liveness`` — the
demotion writer's record of "this identity could not be observed", written
for every three-of-five row the previously deployed build left behind —
projected truthfully but then failed the ``Terminal`` response model's enum
validation. The ``ValidationError`` is a ``ValueError``, so the router's
not-found handler answered ``GET /terminals/{id}`` with 404 for a row that
exists: the row was effectively hidden, appearing absent to the operator
and to the recovery archive that has to enumerate it — and 404 is the very
signal the archive treats as a pane-absence proof.

These tests run the whole supported path — database, projection, response
model, and router — against a real database with only the tmux backend
faked, so the fixture is the row and the code under test is everything
else. They hold three contracts:

* the legacy row renders honestly (terminal/historical, never promoted to
  live or to a provider status it does not have) and is enumerable by the
  same listing the archive reads;
* current rows are byte-for-byte unaffected — a live pane still reports
  its provider status;
* the supported DELETE endpoint remains the row's only deletion path, and
  nothing about that path changed.
