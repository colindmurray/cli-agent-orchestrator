"""Panel-attested native ``/status`` identity repair (cond-0377C).

A missing native session id is repairable metadata, not a reason to throw
away the worker's conversation.  This is the bounded M3-A health
operation: for one *currently live, rostered* terminal, prove the exact
stored pane/session/window/process identity is live and the provider
composer is idle, type literal ``/status`` and *at most* one Enter — the
Enter is withheld entirely where a pinned submission barrier cannot first
prove the text reached the composer — parse only the *panel-attested
branded* provider/build identity fields,
persist the repaired identity atomically, and leave an exclusive
``NativeSessionAttachmentModel`` owner for the exact running pane.

Identity model
==============

The request's ``generation`` is an *expected model generation*, never an
arbitrary physical key.

* A managed/v2 terminal requires it and it must equal ``row.generation``.
* A legacy terminal has ``row.generation is None`` and a roster
  incarnation with generation ``None``; a supplied non-null expected
  model generation is refused.  The durable physical occurrence for a
  legacy row is its nonempty ``callback_target_generation``.
* The physical occurrence (model generation for managed, callback-target
  generation for legacy) is what binds attachment ownership, evidence,
  and the operation itself.  A managed occurrence is a model generation;
  the two are never conflated.

Ownership contract
==================

The operation reuses the existing seams instead of inventing a lease:

* ``callback_recovery.terminal_lifecycle_claim_set`` + ``generation_lifecycle_claims``
  take the canonical lifecycle claim set (model-generation,
  callback-target-generation, and pane as applicable) that terminal
  teardown/Stop itself takes, so Stop/delete is boundedly serialized
  against a running repair — a repair holds these claims from before its
  first status byte until after provider cleanup and the atomic commit.
* ``pane_input_arbiter.pane_input_lease`` serializes every byte written
  to the exact pane.
* ``native_pane_input.TmuxPaneInput`` is the only transport.
* the provider-specific turn-state observers prove the composer is
  idle/ready before anything is typed.
* ``clients.tmux.TmuxClient`` proves the live pane/server identity tuple.
* ``stable_agent_roster.record_native_identity(..., db=db)`` and a
  generation/occurrence-conditional terminal writer commit atomically in
  one shared transaction with the immutable bounded evidence row.

``control_input_service`` is deliberately never used: this is not a
task/control message and must not manufacture its journal or receipts.

Branded pinned builds
=====================

Every parser requires exactly one provider brand/version header and the
provider's strict required fields, and returns the *panel-observed*
provider version.  Receipts, evidence, and parser-key selection use that
observed value, never the caller's assertion; caller/provider metadata
selects the pre-status interaction plan only.

* Codex 0.147.0 — ``>_ OpenAI Codex (v0.147.0)`` and exactly one
  ``Session: <uuid>``.
* Kimi 0.34.0 — ``>_ Kimi Code (v0.34.0)`` and either a live canonical
  ``Session session_<uuid>`` row or the exact ``Session none`` (the
  verified fresh/no-turn missing-ID panel, typed ``identity-still-missing``
  with zero mutation and no fabricated id).  ``Session nonsense`` /
  ``Session -`` are malformed and refused.
* Muse 0.1.0 — ``>_ Muse Code (0.1.0)`` plus the strict status labels.
* Claude 2.1.226 — the branded Settings/Status modal with exact Version
  and Session ID, plus the unconditional Escape/composer recovery.

Claude modal handling (canary 2026-08-10, build 2.1.226)
========================================================

Claude renders ``/status`` as a modal whose ``Session ID:`` row is the
identity.  The single Escape that restores the composer is sent in a
``finally`` after the ``/status`` was submitted, so it runs on success,
parse failure, capture failure, timeout, persistence failure, and
cancellation alike, while the pane lease is still held.  If the Escape
itself also fails, the primary failure is preserved — but success is
never reported until the post-Escape styled composer proof succeeds.

Cancellation and Stop
=====================

Once the off-loop repair has typed ``/status``, a cancellation does NOT
release the lifecycle/pane claims while the worker thread keeps running:
the shared claims and the pane lease are held through provider cleanup
(especially the Claude Escape/composer proof) and released only when the
worker exits the operation.  Stop/delete is intentionally *boundedly
serialized* by the shared lifecycle claims.  The observation phase is
bounded by one shared deadline (readiness + capture + composer proof
compose into a single runway), never three sequential runway-length waits.

Partial-failure ordering (documented, tested)
=============================================

1. Identity observation (``/status`` -> parse -> Escape -> composer
   proof) mutates nothing durable and touches nothing but the pane.
2. Attachment adoption commits first, in its own transaction: it is the
   exclusive-ownership claim for the exact observed pane/process.  If the
   atomic row+roster repair later fails, the conservative attachment
   remains visible and safe (never auto-released merely because metadata
   persistence failed), and an exact retry converges — without another
   ``/status`` when the prior adoption already names this exact owner.
3. The terminal row, the roster lineage, and the bounded evidence digest
   commit in one transaction, only after every exact fact (terminal ID,
   expected model generation, physical occurrence, tmux
   server/session/window/pane, pane PID/start marker, provider/harness,
   live lifecycle, roster live incarnation, parsed id) is re-verified
   immediately before commit.  Same id replays idempotently; a different
   id is a typed conflict and is never overwritten.

Known-identity preflight and operation idempotency
==================================================

* Terminal metadata and roster lineage both carrying the same known id
  with an existing attachment is a typed ``already-known`` no-op (zero
  ``/status``, zero evidence, zero mutation); the same known id with no
  attachment is a typed ``attachment-unresolved`` outcome (a later
  attachment audit owns that concern, not this bounded repair).
* Both known but conflicting is a typed conflict with zero bytes.
* Exactly one known id is verified by ``/status``: the parsed id must
  equal the known value before adoption or any durable mutation.
* ``operation_id`` is an explicit canonical UUID bound to a server-derived
  digest of the immutable request inputs.  An exact successful retry
  adopts the recorded evidence with no second status interaction; the same
  operation id with a changed digest is a typed conflict before pane I/O.
