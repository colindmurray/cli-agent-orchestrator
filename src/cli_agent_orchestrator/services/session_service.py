"""Session service for session-level operations.

This module provides session management functionality for CAO, where a "session"
corresponds to a tmux session that may contain multiple terminal windows (agents).

Session Hierarchy:
- Session: A tmux session (e.g., "cao-my-project")
  - Terminal: A tmux window within the session (e.g., "developer-abc123")
    - Provider: The CLI agent running in the terminal (e.g., KiroCliProvider)

Key Operations:
- list_sessions(): Get all CAO-managed sessions (filtered by SESSION_PREFIX)
- get_session(): Get session details including all terminal metadata
- delete_session(): Clean up session, providers, database records, and tmux session

Session Lifecycle:
1. create_terminal() with new_session=True creates a new tmux session
2. Additional terminals are added via create_terminal() with new_session=False
3. delete_session() removes the entire session and all contained terminals

    The row-preserving counterpart to ``delete_session``. A lifecycle stop
    must both tear the fleet down and keep the truth a resume needs: the
    lifecycle row stays in ``stopped`` with its ``restore_to`` target, the
    forwarded environment survives so a resume relaunches against it, and the
    per-terminal snapshots/recovery artifacts survive because collection goes
    through the same event-driven ``delete_terminal`` path deletion does.

    The order is load-bearing:

    * the session-lifecycle claim is held across the whole operation, so a
      concurrent create cannot add a window between the stopped check and the
      teardown;
    * admission (an open callback recovery) refuses *before* anything is
      written or collected — collecting a terminal mid-recovery would lose
      the one-shot refusal the recovery is adjudicating, and a stop recorded
      while one is open would be a false state;
    * the stopped declaration is written *before* any pane is collected, so a
      write or admission failure deletes nothing, and a fully collected fleet
      can never be left declared working;
    * on a mid-collection failure the row is already stopped, so the
      divergence is visible (not silent) and a retry re-collects what remains
      — re-stopping is idempotent and keeps ``restore_to``.

    Deliberately not symmetric with deletion: this never calls ``forget`` and
    never clears the forwarded env. Releasing the name is the destructive
    ``DELETE`` path's job, kept separate so an ordinary stop can never become
