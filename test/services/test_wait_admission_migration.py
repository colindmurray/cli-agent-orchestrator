"""M7 Stage 2 store: ORM/migration parity, idempotence, restart, rollback.

The M7 admission table composes onto the canonical ``init_db`` lifecycle that
M3-D settled. It is purely additive: no M3-D column moves, and an older binary
that has never heard of M7 reads exactly the schema it had before.
