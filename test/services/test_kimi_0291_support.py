"""Exact Kimi Code version support under the open policy (cond-0331: 0.34.0).

Each accepted build was added as a *separate proven build*, never a range
widening, and stays admitted as the current pin moves forward: already-minted
sessions under older builds must keep validating.  Under the cond-0331 open
policy, Kimi additionally accepts any non-empty semver-shaped version at the
launch identity boundary, while the exact ``SUPPORTED_VERSIONS`` tuple still
gates feature-specific authority.  This suite pins the three properties that
support turns on:

1.  every version gate (contract, route, bridge) accepts 0.34.0, 0.33.0,
    0.32.0, 0.31.0, 0.30.0, 0.29.2, 0.29.1, and 0.29.0 for proven-build
    authority, and rejects unparseable banners; semver-shaped versions outside
    the proven set are accepted at launch but inherit no advanced authority;
2.  a multi-line message on any accepted session is deliverable, because
    the composer-newline table carries a separate proven entry per build
    whose keystroke plans are byte-identical; and
3.  a receipt records the *actual* installed version, so a 0.29.1 binary
    is never described by a 0.29.0, 0.30.0, 0.31.0, 0.32.0, 0.33.0, or
    0.34.0 constant (or the reverse).

This exact ACCEPTED tuple is the cross-repo parity contract for proven
builds: it must equal the conductor's capability.accepted_versions("kimi_cli"),
and each side's suite pins it so a future drift fails its own run.
