"""Wire models for the bounded communications catalog API (design §7).

The fork does not own the vocabulary of kinds, scopes, actors, or delivery
states, so every field that the conductor authors is an opaque carrier.  The
only enumerations here are the envelope bookkeeping the fork is responsible
for: coverage values, reason codes, and byte/count bounds.
