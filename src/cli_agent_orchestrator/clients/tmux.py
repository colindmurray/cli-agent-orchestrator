        ``window.panes[0]`` the previous implementation captured.

        Only that first row is eligible.  Scanning past it for the first row
        that happens to parse would quietly retarget the read at a *sibling*
        pane whenever the real first row is malformed — and this call supplies
        FIFO liveness truth and Output/history reads, so a sibling's screen can
        fabricate a divergence, trigger a re-arm, and be replayed under the
        wrong terminal's identity.  Partial identity is worse than absent
        identity, so an unusable first row fails the observation outright.
        Unlike libtmux's server-wide ``fetch_objs`` that failure is still
        confined to this one window — a malformed row belonging to some other
        window on the server cannot reach it.

        The row also carries the window's own name, which the resolver checks
        against the name it asked for.  ``=`` suppresses tmux's prefix match
        but does **not** stop a *numeric* name being resolved as a window
        *index* first: with a window literally named ``0``, ``-t =sess:=0``
        answers with index 0 — a different window — where libtmux's
        ``windows.get(window_name="0")`` matched by name.  Comparing the name
        tmux reports against the name requested closes that without a second
        call, and makes the resolver self-verifying either way.

        facts an attestation may bind a terminal to.

        ``server_socket_path`` names the tmux server those ids belong to
        (§24.7) and is present only when it can be read: a pane id is
        unique within one server, so a recorded pane id without a recorded

        that a later check could pass against.

        ``session_id`` (``$N``) and ``pane_pid`` follow the same rule and
        exist for the same reason the window id does. A session *name* is
        as mutable and as reusable as a window name — rename the session,
        or kill it and let a later unrelated session take the name, and a
        recorded name resolves somewhere else — so a reattach that means
        "this exact session" has to say ``$N``. ``pane_pid`` identifies one
        incarnation of the pane's root process, which is what distinguishes
        "the pane I registered" from "a pane that reused its id after the
        server restarted". It is a component of the tuple and never a check
        on its own: a survival test that consulted only the pid (or only
        the window) is precisely what let a write land in an unrelated live
        composer.

        The control path's only write primitive.  It never loads or pastes
        a tmux buffer, so no bracketed-paste sentinel can be produced for
        any pane — whether or not that pane advertised ?2004h.  The leakage
        this path exists to remove is structurally impossible here rather
        than conditionally avoided.

        ``send-keys -l`` writes the argument byte for byte: no key-name
        lookup and no backslash-escape processing, so ``\\n`` in the text
        stays two characters.  The trailing ``--`` keeps text beginning
        with ``-`` as text instead of as an option.

        The target is always an immutable pane id *on a named server*.  A
        pane id is unique only within one tmux server, and several servers
        routinely run on one host, so ``%3`` alone is not a target — it is
        a target on whichever server this process happens to resolve.
        ``expected_server_identity`` names the server the caller means, and
        this method proves the pane is on it immediately before the first
        byte.  tmux fails a send to a pane missing *from that server* with
        a non-zero status and writes nothing, so between the two checks a
        stale or foreign target cannot silently land in another pane.

        The parameter is keyword-only and has no default on purpose.  The
        failure this guards against (§24.7) was a helper that omitted its
        socket pinning and wrote into six live production composers, so
        the one thing this signature must not permit is a caller quietly
        inheriting a default.  Passing ``None`` is allowed and always
        refuses: "I have no binding" is a statement, not an omission.

        Args:
            pane_id: Immutable tmux pane id (``%N``).
            text: Single-line literal text, free of ESC, CR and LF.

            expected_server_identity: The socket identity of the tmux
                server the pane must be on. ``None`` refuses.

        Returns:
            The number of literal writes tmux accepted, not counting the
            Enter.  Returned rather than left for the caller to recompute
            from the chunk size: the caller journals this number as its
            record of what reached the pane, and a recomputation would
            silently stop matching the moment the chunking here changed.
