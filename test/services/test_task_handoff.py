    Precisely what this covers, because an earlier docstring here claimed more
    than the body does: both threads pass the same `to_agent`, so this is a
    collision on the *recipient slot*, which
    `ix_task_occurrence_handoffs_pending_recipient` forbids outright. The
    second INSERT raises `IntegrityError`, `_with_session` retries the whole
    function, and the retry meets the precondition against committed state.
    What it proves is the outcome: one accepted, one typed refusal, one pending
    row, and a hot path that stays typed rather than raising
    `MultipleResultsFound`.

    The **cross-slot** case -- one agent as donor of one handoff and recipient
    of another -- is the one no index expresses, and it is *not* exercised
    here. It is guarded by the recipient-must-be-free precondition plus the
    anchored read-then-insert in `_begin_once`, not by any index and not by the
    retry (nothing raises, so nothing retries). A forced interleave of that
    case ended safe with the write lock both on and off, so there is no
    discriminating test to write; see `_anchor_caller_transaction` for what is
    argued from measurement rather than from a failing test.
