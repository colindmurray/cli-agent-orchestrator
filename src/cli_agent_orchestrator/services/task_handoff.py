"""The reversible A -> B -> A worker handback seam (cond-0381 M3-E).

A provider handoff moves a task from worker A to worker B without destroying
A's native conversation. When quota or capability later makes A preferable
again, the supervisor hands the task *back*: it steers B to a safe boundary,
resumes A's original native session exactly, delivers a catch-up packet
describing what B did, and transfers the task. M3-E is the durable seam that
makes that reversible and keeps exactly one worker holding the task at every
boundary.

Four decisions shape this module, and each of them is a bug that has a name.

**A pending handoff is its own row, not a state on the occurrence.** The
accepted design named the state ``handoff-pending``; putting it on
``task_occurrences.state`` is what makes it dangerous. The donor's row would
leave ``open_occurrence_for_agent``, and ``supervisor_drain``'s observer reads
*no open occurrence* as positive ``parked`` — so a concurrent safe drain would
record the donor's **previous** round's digests into its receipt, hand them to
the cohort as a proven boundary, and under Stop announce teardown for the very
pane this milestone keeps alive as rollback insurance. The occurrence stays
``open`` for the donor's whole life; this row carries the handoff.

**Rollback restores the donor by having changed nothing.** Because the
occurrence is untouched while a handoff is pending, restoring the donor is one
compare-and-swap on this row. There is no compensating write to get wrong, no
window where a half-undone transfer is visible, and no way for a rollback to
fail *after* mutating the task.

**A transfer mints a new occurrence; it never rewrites the donor's row.**
``agent_id``, ``round_index`` and the incarnation columns are the immutable
content ``open_occurrence`` adopts a response-loss retry against; two unique
indexes are keyed on them; and both ``retire_worker_pane`` and
``admit_fresh_successor`` read by agent and then finalize by occurrence id with
no ``agent_id`` predicate — so a moved row lets one worker's teardown finalize
another worker's live round. Completing a handoff finalizes the donor
``superseded`` and opens a fresh occurrence for the recipient, in one
transaction, exactly as lost-pane recovery already does for a successor.

**Nothing here carries a native session id.** A handback never moves a native
conversation between workers: the recipient's own session is resumed exactly by
M3-B, whose roster predicates already refuse a cross-harness bind. Recording a
native id here would be a second, unenforced copy of a fact that is only ever
true of one side of the handoff.

What this module stores is references, digests and evidence: occurrence and
incarnation ids, a SHA-256 digest of the catch-up packet, an observed turn
state, and a derived control id. It stores no packet body, no task text, no
provider output, and no secrets. The packet bytes belong to the caller.

    Same reason as M3-D's copy: SQLAlchemy's Session transaction is lazy on
    SQLite, so a ``begin_nested`` issued first becomes the outer transaction and
    RELEASE commits it — which would make the caller's later rollback unable to
    undo this write. Load-bearing here beyond hygiene: ``complete_handoff``
    finalizes one occurrence and opens another inside one savepoint, and a
    RELEASE that committed would make a failure between them observable.

    Anchoring at all is the load-bearing half, and it is easy to miss why.
    pysqlite emits ``BEGIN`` only before DML, so an unanchored session runs its
    *reads* outside any transaction and opens one only at the first write — a
    read-then-insert precondition then spans two transactions and decides on
    state that may already be stale. Anchoring puts the read and the insert in
    one transaction; ``immediate`` upgrades that transaction's lock from
    deferred to RESERVED at ``BEGIN``, so a concurrent writer cannot take the
    write lock while the precondition is being read. Measured: with
    ``immediate`` on, a second writer blocks during the read phase; with it
    off, a second writer can acquire the write lock during that phase. The
    caller-supplied-session path additionally has no retry to fall back on.

    Honest limit: no test in this suite discriminates ``immediate`` on from
    off. The concurrent-begin test collides on the recipient slot, which an
    index forbids outright, so contention there raises ``IntegrityError`` and
    the retry converges regardless. A forced interleave of the *cross-slot*
    case — one agent as donor of one handoff and recipient of another, which no
    index expresses — ended safe in both modes when it was built, so no
    discriminating test exists to write. What the flag prevents is argued from
    the lock measurement above, not from a failing test.

    The chain otherwise verifies only that the caller is *consistent* — the
    transfer names the incarnation the delivery recorded — never that it is
    *right*. The roster is the one authority on which pane belongs to the
    recipient, and the module's own hold path already treats the supervisor's
    roster view as stale-able. Three outcomes (cond-0441):

    * The roster binds the pane to *another* agent: refuse. The packet reached
      a pane that is not the recipient's, and recording it would stamp the
      successor occurrence with a foreign pane — the record every later reader
      trusts for "who executes this task, on which pane", which the recovery
      paths that finalize by occurrence id would then act on as the wrong
      physical worker.
    * The roster binds the pane to the recipient under a *different*
      incarnation id: correct the assertion to the roster's binding rather
      than refuse. The packet genuinely reached the recipient's pane; only
      the supervisor's name for it was stale.
    * The roster is silent: accept the assertion. Deliberate, matching the
      admission hold's posture — an agent with no roster incarnation cannot
      be a handoff party in a real flow, and a pane no roster vouches for is
      indistinguishable from the ordinary lost-pane state recovery already
      handles.

    "Silent" is judged against the pane's *live* binding, never against the
    caller's asserted generation alone. Terminal reuse across generations is
    designed-for, so the exact lookup keyed on a stale generation either
    misses the live row entirely — while the roster positively binds that
    same pane to someone under another generation — or hits a *retired*
    history row, which vouches for nothing: a retired incarnation read no
    packet, and the roster's own ``assert_admission_ready`` refuses that
    same pair. Both cases fall through to the unique live incarnation of the

    Returns a refusal sentence, or ``None`` when the agent may be written to.

    Both sides of a pending handoff are held, for different named reasons. The
    donor is held because the catch-up packet describes a state it must stop
    changing: a steer that lands after the digest was taken means the packet
    the recipient reads is already wrong. The recipient is held because the
    supervisor's roster view can be stale — it believes that agent dormant —
    and task input that arrives before the packet has the recipient acting on
    context it does not have, for an occurrence it does not yet hold.

    The recipient's exemption is exact: the one derived control id the packet
    is delivered under, and nothing else. Without it the hold would refuse its
    own packet and no handback could ever complete.

    **When the store cannot be read.** A pending handoff is a *row* in
    ``task_occurrence_handoffs``, so what the failure means depends on whether
    that table exists.

    No table means no rows, which means no pending handoff is recoverable
    *from this file* — not that none is pending. Normally the two are the
    same: ``begin_handoff`` writes that table, so it cannot have succeeded
    against a store that lacks it, and there is no suspended authority to
    protect. But the fact is about this file's lineage, not about the
    installation. An operator who restores a backup predating the table while
    a handback is pending loses the pending row with the old file, and the
    probe then admits while the recipient still holds a packet asserting it
    is taking over — duplicate task authority until settlement, where
    ``complete_handoff`` fails typed and rollback is the exit. That needs
    operator error compounded with a pending handoff, and refusing every
    installation that has not run M3-E yet to preclude it would cost every
    steer, tell and operator message in exchange for protecting nothing. So
    it admits — and it logs a warning, because an admission this decision
    rests on should never be invisible.

    A table that exists but cannot be answered is genuinely unknown: a pending
    row may be sitting in it. Admitting to a held donor invalidates the packet
    digest its recipient is about to act on, and admitting to a held recipient
    has it act on context it does not have. Both are the corrupted-state
    transition this hold exists to prevent, so that case still fails closed —
    but it raises ``TaskHandoffHoldUndecidable`` rather than reporting a
    handback that nothing observed.

    This is the form the byte-admission path must use, and the reason is the

    M3-B, and the exact executor deliberately allocates a terminal id it has
    *proven absent* from the managed-launch reservation table — so the restored
    pane is not "managed" at all. A hold keyed on a reservation would therefore
    be inert for every recipient, which is to say inert in exactly the flow the
    recipient-side hold exists for. The same is true of any donor that was ever
    recovered, which is the ordinary steady state after a pane loss.

    The roster is the one authority that knows both populations: a managed
    launch binds its generation under the reservation's stable agent id, and an
    exact reincarnation rebinds the pre-existing agent to the successor
    incarnation. One indexed read answers for both.

    A terminal with no roster incarnation is not held. That is not a bypass —
    an agent with no incarnation cannot be a handoff party, because a handoff
    names agents that hold or will hold a task occurrence.

    A roster that *raises* is the one case with no honest answer at all: it
    leaves the pane's agent unnamed, so the hold question cannot even be asked,
    let alone answered "no". That still fails closed, and unlike a missing
    handback table it is not a small fault being amplified — every managed
    lane reads the roster, so a store that cannot answer it is already broken.
