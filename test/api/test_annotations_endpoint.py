"""GET /annotations — the one additive fork seam (work-state design §9.5).

The seam's whole value is that it never needs a second edit, so most of what is
asserted here is an ABSENCE: no caller-reachable path, no kind vocabulary, no
role vocabulary, no schema pin, and no error surface for anything read off
disk. A test suite that only checked the happy path would let any of those be
added back without noticing.

Every test points the reader at a scratch directory by patching
``annotations.annotation_root``. That function is the test seam and not an
operator knob — ``test_the_location_is_not_configurable_from_the_environment``
pins that no CAO or conductor knob moves it, while
``test_xdg_state_home_resolves_like_the_producer`` pins that the one
environment input is the producer's own resolution rule.
