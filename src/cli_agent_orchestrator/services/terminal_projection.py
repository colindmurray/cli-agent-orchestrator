"""One read projection over both terminal stores, for every human view.

The CLI and the dashboard used to answer "what terminals are there?"
from different queries, and disagreed in ways that were not cosmetic. A
window that had been deleted still had a row, nothing ever demoted it,
and status was derived live — so its card reported provider status
``Unknown`` forever, indistinguishable from a healthy worker whose state
had not been detected yet. ``cao session status`` picked ``terminals[0]``
from the raw list, so with several stale rows it reliably named a dead
one. And managed v2 terminals appeared in neither view, because they live
in their own table by design.

This module is the single answer to that question, and both views are
required to render it identically. What it adds is a *read*: the v2
isolation invariant is a write/consume boundary — old-binary machine
paths (v1 query, list, watchdog, cleanup) must keep zero v2 visibility —
not a rule that humans may not see managed workers. Every projected row
is explicitly labelled with its ``protocol_vintage`` so the two vintages
are distinguishable rather than blended.

Liveness here is observation, never inference. One enumeration of the
tmux server answers every row at the same instant; a row whose recorded
pane is absent from a server that *did* answer is dead; a row whose pane
resolves to a different incarnation is superseded; and a row that could
not be observed at all is ``unknown-liveness`` — not live, not reaped,
not attachable. Nothing here writes to a pane, spends a provider turn, or
kills anything: a demotion is something the system noticed, not something
it did.
