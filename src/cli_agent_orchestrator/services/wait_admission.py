"""Who a wait message is for, and whether it was ever admitted (M7 Stage 2).

This is the durable admission contract underneath the registered timer-wait
surface. M7's timer consumer now uses it immediately before creating the one
exact-generation inbox wake; this module still owns no timer, suppression,
delivery, cancellation, Stop, route, or CLI state of its own.

Three guarantees, and the failure each one prevents:

**Exact owner, exact generation.** A wait message names one stable agent's one
current incarnation: agent, incarnation id, terminal, generation, lineage,
native session id, and (optionally) the restore contract it was relaunched
from. Every part is compared exactly against the roster, including the parts
that are legitimately ``None``. A worker that was stopped and came back on a
new pane is a *different* incarnation, and a message composed against the old
one is denied rather than quietly re-aimed at whatever now holds the terminal
id. There is no system owner and no generation-less wait: a message with
nobody exact to belong to is not admitted at all.

**Ambiguity refuses.** If two live incarnations share a terminal id (legacy or
corrupt state), admission denies instead of picking the row that happens to
sort first. Picking would be a silent misdelivery into someone else's
conversation, which is the exact outcome this contract exists to make
impossible.

**Response loss replays, divergence refuses.** The admission id is derived from
the caller's durable operation id, so the process that committed a verdict and
died before reading it re-derives the same id and re-reads the same verdict —
including a denial, and including after the roster has moved on. A retry whose
canonical bytes differ from the stored request is not a replay; it is a second,
different message wearing the first one's operation id, and it is refused.

The receipt is a digest over the operation, the owner identity, the message,
and the verdict. It is recorded on every row, admitted or denied, so a later
owner can prove which decision it is acting on rather than re-deriving one.
