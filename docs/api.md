# CLI Agent Orchestrator API Documentation

Base URL: `http://localhost:9889` (default)

## Health Check

### GET /health
Check if the server is running.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "service": "cli-agent-orchestrator",
  "tracker_capabilities": ["atomic-issue-snapshot", "..."]
}
```

---

## Issue tracker snapshots

### POST /tracker/issues/snapshot

Export a selected issue cohort and its current reference closure from one
SQLite read transaction. The request body is strict: unknown fields are
rejected.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "project_id": "cao-system",
  "keys": ["cond-0002", "cond-0001"]
}
```

The response uses schema `cao-tracker-issue-snapshot-v1`. `selected_keys` is
sorted, and `selected_keys_digest` hashes each sorted key followed by a newline
using `sha256-sorted-newline-v1`. The response contains:

- every materialized issue shaped like `GET /tracker/issues/{issue_key}`,
  except that issue events are omitted;
- every comment and every native link touching any materialized issue;
- transitive `part-of` roots;
- the current native-link and title/body/comment reference closure;
- relevant project rows and typed unresolved discovered references; and
- `{"consistency":{"kind":"sqlite-read-transaction"}}`.

The response is deterministic for unchanged tracker state and contains no
capture timestamp or transaction identifier. This endpoint reads current
tracker truth only; it neither reconstructs historical cohort membership nor
mutates tracker records.

Duplicate keys and malformed requests return 400, missing selected keys return
404, and selected keys belonging to another project return 409. Clients can
detect support through `atomic-issue-snapshot` in the health response's
`tracker_capabilities` list.

## Providers

### GET /agents/providers
List available providers with installation status.

**Response:** Array of provider objects
```json
[
  {
    "name": "kiro_cli",
    "binary": "kiro-cli",
    "installed": true
  },
  {
    "name": "claude_code",
    "binary": "claude",
    "installed": true
  },
  {
    "name": "codex",
    "binary": "codex",
    "installed": true
  },
  {
    "name": "kimi_cli",
    "binary": "kimi",
    "installed": false
  },
  {
    "name": "hermes",
    "binary": "hermes",
    "installed": true
  },
  {
    "name": "copilot_cli",
    "binary": "copilot",
    "installed": false
  }
]
```

**Note:** The `installed` field checks if the provider binary is available in the system PATH via `shutil.which()`.

---

## Sessions

### POST /sessions
Create a new session with one terminal.

**Parameters:**
- `provider` (string, required): Provider type ("kiro_cli", "claude_code", "codex", "antigravity_cli", "hermes", "kimi_cli", "copilot_cli", "opencode_cli", or "cursor_cli")
- `agent_profile` (string, required): Agent profile name
- `session_name` (string, optional): Custom session name
- `working_directory` (string, optional): Working directory for the agent session

**Request body (optional, JSON):**
- `profile_contract` (object, optional): The conductor-preflighted `cao-profile-launch-contract-v1` expectation (`profile`, `role: supervisor`, `provider`, `model`, `effort`, `provenance`, `source_path`, `sha256`). It is validated against the profile source the runtime loads exactly once, before any tmux/session/provider effect: a divergence answers 409 with the divergent fields and a retry path (re-preflight, retry with the fresh contract); a malformed contract answers 400. A contract naming a provider/path whose adapter cannot consume the frozen profile exactly is refused with an operation-scoped 422 naming provider, canonical source path, reason, and recovery — with zero effects and no receipt. The gate decides over one immutable launch-material object (frozen profile, resolved model/effort, system prompt, composed skill catalog, effective allowed-tools policy) built from the same single read and threaded unchanged into the launch: each adapter supports a sealed launch only when every nonempty behavior-bearing field is actually consumed from immutable per-launch argv/env/file material. Dropped prompt/skills/policy (Cursor/Muse/Hermes carry no prompt channel), provider-native `--agent`/named-profile indirection, and shared-file MCP merges (Antigravity `mcpServers` into `~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json`) all refuse. `name`/`description`/`capabilities`/`tags` are discovery metadata and never affect the decision. An absent contract launches normally. `source_path` compares in canonical form, so an aliased/symlinked spelling of the same physical profile agrees — but path and digest must both match, so identical bytes at a different canonical path still diverge. `sha256` is over the exact source bytes as read (line endings significant: a CRLF profile and its LF rewrite are different digests). The field is strict-parsed once at the boundary: a non-object value, missing or extra fields, wrong schema/role, wrong value types, a non-absolute/non-`built-in:` source path, or a digest that is not exactly 64 hexadecimal characters answers 400; uppercase hex is accepted and normalized, receipts always emit lowercase. Well-formed values that merely differ (including a valid digest/path/provenance for other bytes) answer 409 with the divergent fields and a re-preflight retry path. `provenance` for the installed agent store is the canonical `installed-agent-store` (conductor vocabulary), never `"local"` on new receipts; a legacy `"local"` claim is accepted only for a source inside the installed agent store with a matching digest, and stored receipts are echoed unchanged.

**Response:** Terminal object (201 Created). A sealed-capable launch carries the runtime-authored `cao-profile-receipt-v1` in `profile_receipt` — the profile, route, provenance, source path, and digest the runtime actually launched with. A legacy launch (unsupported adapter, no contract) records no exact receipt: `profile_receipt` stays null.

**Note:** A named profile that is unavailable to CAO's configured stores refuses the launch with 400 instead of starting a fallback-provider terminal with no profile. A launch that cannot record what it launched with is not a launch.

### GET /sessions
List all sessions.

**Response:** Array of session objects

### GET /sessions/{session_name}
Get details of a specific session.

**Response:** Session object with terminals list

### DELETE /sessions/{session_name}
Delete a session and all its terminals.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

---

## Terminals

**Note:** All `terminal_id` path parameters must be 8-character hexadecimal strings (e.g., "a1b2c3d4").

### POST /sessions/{session_name}/terminals
Create an additional terminal in an existing session.

**Parameters:**
- `provider` (string, required): Provider type
- `agent_profile` (string, required): Agent profile name
- `working_directory` (string, optional): Working directory for the terminal
- `allowed_tools` (string, optional): Comma-separated list of allowed CAO tools for the worker.
- `caller_id` (string, optional): Terminal ID of the creating terminal (8-character hexadecimal). Recorded so `send_message` can default replies to the caller (issue #284).
- `defer_init` (bool, optional, default `false`): When `true`, return as soon as the tmux window and DB record exist, without waiting for `provider.initialize()` to finish. The provider is still created and initialized — but on a background asyncio task on cao-server, so the HTTP round-trip stays under ~2s regardless of provider startup latency. Used by the MCP `assign` tool to keep tool-call latency well under kiro-cli 2.11's ~60s per-tool client timeout, and to allow multiple concurrent assigns to run their init phases in parallel.

**Request body (optional, JSON):** the deferred-init message payload is sent in the body — not query params — so prompt content is not exposed in HTTP access logs and is not subject to URL-length limits.
- `initial_message` (string, optional): When `defer_init=true`, this message is delivered to the newly created worker via `send_input` after `provider.initialize()` completes. Ignored if `defer_init=false`. Ordering: init runs first, then message delivery, both on the same background task.
- `initial_message_orchestration_type` (string, optional): One of `assign` or `handoff`. Passed through to `send_input` for plugin event emission when `initial_message` is delivered.

**Response:** Terminal object (201 Created). When `defer_init=true`, the returned status is `unknown` (the provider is still initializing on a background task); poll `GET /terminals/{id}` for the live status before sending further input.

### GET /sessions/{session_name}/terminals
List all terminals in a session.

**Response:** Array of terminal objects

### GET /terminals/{terminal_id}
Get terminal details.

**Response:** Terminal object
```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "name": "string",
  "provider": "kiro_cli|claude_code|codex|antigravity_cli|hermes|kimi_cli|copilot_cli|opencode_cli|cursor_cli",
  "session_name": "string",
  "agent_profile": "string",
  "caller_id": "string|null",
  "status": "idle|processing|completed|waiting_user_answer|error",
  "last_active": "timestamp"
}
```

### POST /terminals/{terminal_id}/input
Send input to a terminal.

**Parameters:**
- `message` (string, required): Message to send

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

### POST /terminals/{terminal_id}/key
Send a tmux key sequence to a terminal. Use this for interactive prompts that
require non-text key presses, such as Hermes clarify picker navigation.

The endpoint is generic, but the only in-tree structured consumer today is the
Hermes path of `answer_user_prompt`. Other providers can use it in the future
when they expose equivalent prompt states or key-navigation flows.

**Parameters:**
- `key` (string, required): allowed tmux key name: `Up`, `Down`, `Left`,
  `Right`, `Enter`, `Tab`, `Escape`, `Space`, a single alphanumeric key, or a
  `C-`, `M-`, or `S-` modifier combo such as `C-c` or `M-x`

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

### GET /terminals/{terminal_id}/output
Get terminal output.

**Parameters:**
- `mode` (string, optional): Output mode - "full" (default), "last", or "tail"
  - `"full"` returns the StatusMonitor rolling buffer (most recent ~8KB of streamed output), not unbounded scrollback. Long sessions are truncated to the tail; use the on-disk terminal log for complete history.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "output": "string",
  "mode": "string"
}
```

### GET /terminals/{terminal_id}/working-directory
Get the current working directory of a terminal's pane.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "working_directory": "/home/user/project"
}
```

**Note:** Returns `null` if working directory is unavailable.

### POST /terminals/{terminal_id}/exit
Send provider-specific exit command to terminal.

**Behavior:**
- Calls the provider's `exit_cli()` method to get the exit command
- Text commands (e.g., `/exit`, `quit`) are sent as literal text via `send_input()`
- Key sequences prefixed with `C-` or `M-` (e.g., `C-d` for Ctrl+D) are sent as tmux key sequences via `send_special_key()`, which tmux interprets as actual key presses

| Provider | Exit Command | Type |
|----------|-------------|------|
| kiro_cli | `/exit` | Text |
| claude_code | `/exit` | Text |
| codex | `/exit` | Text |
| antigravity_cli | `/exit` | Text |
| hermes | `/exit` | Text |
| kimi_cli | `/exit` | Text |
| copilot_cli | `/exit` | Text |

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

### DELETE /terminals/{terminal_id}
Delete a terminal.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

---

## Inbox (Terminal-to-Terminal Messaging)

### POST /terminals/{receiver_id}/inbox/messages
Send a message to another terminal's inbox.

**Parameters:**
- `sender_id` (string, required): Sender terminal ID
- `message` (string, required): Message content

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message_id": "string",
  "sender_id": "string",
  "receiver_id": "string",
  "created_at": "timestamp"
}
```

**Behavior:**
- Messages are queued and delivered when the receiver terminal is IDLE
- Messages are delivered in order (oldest first)
- Delivery is automatic via event-driven status detection

---

## Memory

REST mirror of the `cao memory` CLI. All `/memory` endpoints return `404` with
`"Memory system is disabled"` when `memory.enabled` is false in settings.json;
use `GET /settings/memory` to discover the enabled state (e.g. for hiding UI).

Keys must match `^[a-z0-9-]{1,60}$` and `scope_id` must match
`^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]{1,128}$`; malformed values return `422`.

Because the server's working directory is not the user's project, project scope
is addressed by an explicit `scope_id` query parameter (the resolved project
ID). This intentionally diverges from the MCP `memory_forget` tool, which
resolves context from the calling terminal.

Known inconsistency: the internal `GET /terminals/{id}/memory-context` endpoint
predates this contract and returns an empty `200` (not `404`) when memory is
disabled.

### GET /settings/memory
Return whether the memory subsystem is enabled.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "enabled": true
}
```

### GET /memory
List stored memories across all projects (the CLI's `cao memory list --all`).

**Parameters:**
- `scope` (string, optional): Filter by scope (`global`, `project`, `session`, `agent`)
- `type` (string, optional): Filter by memory type (`user`, `feedback`, `project`, `reference`)
- `scope_id` (string, optional): Filter to one project/session/agent
- `limit` (integer, optional): Max results, 1–100 (default: 50)

**Response:**
```json
[
  {
    "key": "string",
    "scope": "string",
    "scope_id": "string|null",
    "memory_type": "string",
    "tags": "string",
    "created_at": "timestamp",
    "updated_at": "timestamp"
  }
]
```

`scope_id` is the project ID for project memories, the session/agent ID for
those scopes, and `null` for global.

### GET /memory/export
Export one memory scope as an archive bundle (the CLI's `cao memory export`).
Streams a gzipped tarball of the OKF bundle (topic files plus `index.md` and
`manifest.md`).

**Parameters:**
- `scope` (string, required): Scope to export (`global`, `project`, or `federated`; `400` for the private `session`/`agent` scopes — there is no include-private escape hatch over HTTP)
- `format` (string, optional): Archive format (default: `okf`; `400` on unknown formats)
- `scope_id` (string): Required for `project` scope (`400` if missing)
- `include_history` (boolean, optional): Include `history/<key>.md` files (default: `false`)
- `redact` (boolean, optional): Redact secret matches instead of skipping the topic (default: `false`)

**Response:** `200` with `Content-Type: application/gzip` — the bundle tarball
as the response body.

When API auth is enabled, this endpoint requires a token carrying at least the
read scope (`cao:read`, `cao:write`, or `cao:admin`); requests without one are
`403`'d.

### GET /memory/{key}
Show a memory by key (first match wins when the same key exists in several
scopes; narrow with `scope`/`scope_id`).

**Parameters:**
- `scope` (string, optional): Scope to search in
- `scope_id` (string, optional): Project/session/agent to search in

**Response:** the list entry shape plus `"content"` (the latest wiki section).
`404` if no exact key match.

### DELETE /memory/{key}
Delete a memory by key.

**Parameters:**
- `scope` (string, optional): Scope of the memory (default: `project`)
- `scope_id` (string): Required for `project`, `session`, and `agent` scopes (`400` if missing)

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

`404` if the key does not exist in the scope.

### DELETE /memory
Clear all memories in a scope. Best-effort: deletion continues past
per-item failures and reports how many were removed.

**Parameters:**
- `scope` (string, required): Scope to clear
- `scope_id` (string): Required for `project`, `session`, and `agent` scopes (`400` if missing)

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "deleted_count": 3
}
```

## Stable-Agent Roster

The roster is the fork-owned durable record of stable CAO agents, their
harness-native conversation lineages, and their disposable physical
incarnations.  The roster read surface is **read-only** — it never
mutates roster state — and the durable records are written by the launch
seams (managed-v2 `bind_native`, unmanaged terminal creation, admission
completion, teardown retirement) and by the **write-scoped**
native-identity repair route documented below.

The four read routes require at least the **read** authorization scope
(`cao:read`); write and admin scopes also satisfy them.  The repair
`POST` requires the **write** or **admin** scope.  Legacy, missing,
corrupt, or unknown-version rows are reported truthfully and never crash
a read or audit.

### GET /roster/agents

Every stable agent, oldest first.

**Query parameters:**
- `session_name` (optional): scope the listing to one CAO session name.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "schema": "cao-m3-roster-list-v1",
  "agents": [
    {
      "agent_id": "…", "session_name": "…", "role": "worker",
      "profile_family": "developer", "disposition": "live",
      "disposition_known": true,
      "resume_contract_version": "cao-m3-resume-contract-v1",
      "current_lineage_id": "…", "current_incarnation_id": "…",
      "revision": 3, "created_at": "…", "updated_at": "…"
    }
  ]
}
```

`role` is `supervisor` or `worker`; `disposition` is one of `live`,
`dormant`, `identity_missing`, `retired` (`disposition_known` is `false`
for an unrecognized stored value).  An `identity_missing` agent has a
current lineage with no native session id — truthful, never fabricated,
and never a blocker for Stop.

### GET /roster/agents/{agent_id}

One stable agent with its full lineage and incarnation history.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "schema": "cao-m3-roster-agent-v1",
  "agent": { "…": "…", "current_lineage": { "…": "…" }, "current_incarnation": { "…": "…" } },
  "lineages": [ { "lineage_id": "…", "harness": "…", "native_session_id": "…",
                  "acquisition_method": "…", "route_provenance": { "…": "…" },
                  "predecessor_lineage_id": "…", "lineage_origin": "…" } ],
  "incarnations": [ { "incarnation_id": "…", "terminal_id": "…", "generation": "…",
                      "pane_id": "…", "disposition": "bound|admitted|retired" } ]
}
```

**Errors:** an unknown `agent_id` returns **404** with
`{"detail": "unknown stable agent: …"}`.

### GET /roster/terminals/{terminal_id}

The roster incarnation for one terminal, or an explicit null.

**Query parameters:**
- `generation` (optional): read exactly that generation's incarnation.

**Semantics:** with `generation`, the exact incarnation for that
(terminal, generation) pair, or `null`.  Without it, the **unique live**
incarnation of the terminal id — two live incarnations sharing a
terminal id (legacy/corrupt state) return **409** ("ambiguous") rather
than picking an arbitrary historical row.

**Response (200):**
```json
{ "schema": "cao-m3-roster-incarnation-v1", "incarnation": { "…": "…" } }
```

### GET /roster/audit

A truthful, **non-mutating** dry-run audit for later migration and
status repair.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "schema": "cao-m3-roster-audit-v1",
  "agents_total": 0, "lineages_total": 0, "incarnations_total": 0,
  "live_count": 0, "dormant_count": 0, "identity_missing_count": 0,
  "identity_missing_agents": [],
  "legacy_candidates_count": 0,
  "legacy_candidates": [ { "terminal_id": "…", "session_name": "…",
                           "provider": "…", "native_session_id": "…" } ],
  "problems": [],
  "problems_count": 0
}
```

`legacy_candidates` lists live terminals that already carry a native
session id but have no roster incarnation yet (migration candidates).
`problems` reports corrupt provenance JSON, unknown dispositions,
unknown resume-contract versions, dangling current pointers, and
agent/incarnation disposition inconsistencies — never fatal.  The audit
never mutates roster state.

### POST /roster/terminals/{terminal_id}/native-identity-repair

**Dark/manual, write-scoped.**  Repair one currently live rostered
terminal's missing native session id from its provider's exact
panel-attested `/status`.  The operation proves the exact stored
pane/session/window/process identity is live and the provider composer
idle, types literal `/status` once under the canonical lifecycle claim
set and the per-pane input lease, parses only the pinned
provider/build identity fields, adopts an exclusive native-session
attachment owner, and commits the terminal row, the roster lineage, and
a bounded evidence digest atomically.  It is a manual health operation,
never an automatic migration, reincarnation, or Pause/Stop behavior.

Requires the **write** or **admin** authorization scope.

**Request body** (all fields are strings; `operation_id` is required and
must be a canonical lowercase UUID):

```json
{
  "operation_id": "00000000-0000-4000-8000-0000000000bb",
  "generation": "00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001",
  "provider_version": "2.1.226",
  "physical_occurrence": "00000000-0000-4000-8000-0000000000aa"
}
```

- `operation_id` — explicit canonical UUID bound to a server-derived
  digest of the immutable resolved request facts; an exact retry is
  idempotent, a changed request is a typed conflict.
- `generation` — expected model generation of a managed terminal; omit
  for legacy rows (which have none).
- `provider_version` — installed provider build that selects the
  interaction plan; the panel-attested build is what is recorded.
- `physical_occurrence` — the durable physical identity of the terminal
  (its callback-target generation for a legacy row, or its model
  generation for a managed row); required for legacy rows.

**Response:** the typed outcome is returned directly as the body
(not wrapped in the generic `{"detail": ...}` envelope — see the error
format note below):

```json
{
  "schema": "cao-native-status-repair-v1",
  "status": "repaired",
  "reason": null,
  "detail": null,
  "operation_id": "…",
  "request_digest": "…",
  "terminal_id": "…",
  "generation": "…",
  "native_session_id": "…",
  "evidence_sha256": "…",
  "parser_key": "…",
  "task_bytes_submitted": false
}
```

`status` is one of `repaired`, `already-known`, `identity-still-missing`
(Kimi, before its first session-creating action), `refused`, or
`errored`.  `repaired`, `already-known`, and `identity-still-missing`
map to **200**; `refused` maps by its `reason` (400 for invalid
input/unsupported build/missing generation or physical occurrence, 404
for a missing terminal or roster incarnation, 409 for identity/version/
attachment/binding conflicts, 503 for transient store or binding
failures); `errored` maps to **500**.  The body never contains raw pane
output, raw exceptions, or evidence from another operation.

The repair's `/status` observation is **at-most-once**: an exact
observation-attempt journal is written atomically at the byte seam, so
exactly one caller may ever type `/status` for a given operation id.
An exact retry adopts the committed evidence, adopts the journaled
`identity-still-missing` verdict, or returns a typed
`observation-attempt-ambiguous` refusal — it never sends `/status`
again.  A changed request under the same operation id is a typed
conflict before any pane I/O.

### GET /roster/legacy-audit

**Read-scoped** (requires `cao:read`; write/admin also satisfy it).
The truthful, strictly read-only live legacy audit (cond-0377D):
classifies every currently live terminal row as an eligible migration
candidate or a typed refusal.  It never types bytes, never initializes a
provider session, never reserves an attachment, never calls self-healing
metadata readers, and never persists an audit receipt.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "schema": "cao-m3-legacy-audit-v1",
  "occurrence_id": "…",
  "generated_at": "…",
  "terminals_total": 1,
  "eligible_count": 1,
  "refusals_count": 0,
  "candidates": [
    {
      "terminal_id": "…", "vintage": "legacy|v2", "managed": false,
      "generation": null, "physical_occurrence": "…",

      "incarnation_disposition": "bound",

      "lineage_native_session_id": null,
      "binding_native_session_id": null,
      "attachment_state": null,
      "attachment_owner_terminal_id": null,
      "attachment_owner_generation": null,
      "attachment_native_session_id": null,
      "session_probe_required": false,
      "build_provenance": {
        "source": "pinned-legacy-plan-fallback|managed-v2-binding",
        "observed": false, "provider_version": null, "plan_pin": "2.1.226"
      },
      "occurrence_id": "…",
      "classification": "eligible",
      "reason": null,
      "observed_at": "…",
      "evidence_digest": "…"
    }
  ]
}
```

- Liveness is never inferred from a DB row alone: an eligible candidate
  binds the DB lifecycle state, the exact stored/live tmux tuple, and PID
  start-marker equality.  Unreadable, dead, ambiguous, mismatched,
  corrupt, missing-occurrence, unsupported-provider, known-id, retired,
  conflicting-owner, and missing-agent shapes are explicit typed refusals
  (`classification` + closed `reason`).
- `session_probe_required` is `true` for a missing-ID Kimi candidate:
  its session existence is truthfully unknown before the bounded probe,
  and `/status` never creates a session.
- `build_provenance` states whether the provider build came from a
  durable managed-v2 binding (`observed: true`) or is an explicit
  unaudited pinned-legacy-plan fallback (`observed: false`) — a fallback
  is never described as observed build proof.
- `evidence_digest` is a canonical SHA-256 of the bounded candidate facts
  (including `build_provenance`); one later migration request binds it.

### POST /roster/legacy-migrations

**Write-scoped** (requires `cao:write` or `cao:admin`).  The explicit
opt-in one-candidate migration coordinator (cond-0377D): consumes
exactly one eligible audit candidate and invokes the exact
native-identity repair operation under a repair operation id derived
deterministically from the migration operation id.  The read-only audit
endpoint is not a migration switch; this route is the only producer, and
nothing runs automatically at launch.

**Request body:**
```json
{
  "operation_id": "00000000-0000-4000-8000-0000000000bb",
  "terminal_id": "a1b2c3d4",
  "provider": "claude_code",
  "generation": null,
  "physical_occurrence": "00000000-0000-4000-8000-0000000000aa",
  "provider_version": "2.1.226",
  "audit_occurrence_id": "00000000-0000-4000-8000-0000000000dd",
  "audit_candidate_digest": "d" * 64
}
```

- `operation_id` — the caller's stable canonical UUID; the durable
  intent row (with the audit digest and the deterministic repair
  operation id) is persisted before any repair interaction.
- `audit_occurrence_id` + `audit_candidate_digest` — the exact audit
  occurrence and candidate digest the caller observed; the candidate is
  revalidated from current facts (including the digest) before any repair
  interaction and again at the irreversible persistence seam.
- `provider_version` — plan selection only; the response's
  `build_provenance` carries the audit-derived build fact and is never
  presented as observed proof.

**Semantics — at-most-once and response loss:**
- The `pending -> attempt-started` transition is an atomic execution
  claim: exactly one caller may invoke the repair; every loser
  query-adopts or returns a typed `in-progress`/`unresolved` outcome with
  zero repair invocation.  Combined with the repair's observation-attempt
  journal, the total `/status` interaction count for one operation is
  exactly one.
- An exact duplicate retry query-adopts the same migration AND repair
  operations (identical `repair_operation_id`, identical evidence).
- A changed request under the same `operation_id` is a typed
  `operation-conflict` before any provider or roster effect.
- Response loss: committed repair evidence is the authoritative
  `migrated` truth (a pane that exits after the commit is a separate
  lifecycle fact and never downgrades it); a journaled
  `identity-still-missing` verdict is adopted without resending; a
  journaled observation without committed evidence is typed
  `repair-attempt-ambiguous`; a total absence is `repair-attempt-unresolved`.
- Never replays task input, never creates a fresh conversation, never
  reincarnates a pane, never changes task/role/profile, never
  auto-creates Kimi's lazy session, and never overwrites a known native
  id.  Additive history only; rollback
  (`CAO_LEGACY_MIGRATION_PRODUCER_ENABLED=0`) disables only new
  operations while prior rows remain queryable/adoptable.

**Response:** the typed outcome dict is returned as the body:
```json
{
  "schema": "cao-m3-legacy-migration-v1",
  "status": "migrated", "reason": null, "detail": null,
  "operation_id": "…", "request_digest": "…",
  "repair_operation_id": "…", "repair_status": "repaired",
  "repair_reason": null,
  "terminal_id": "…", "provider": "…",
  "generation": null, "physical_occurrence": "…",
  "provider_version": "2.1.226",
  "build_provenance": { "source": "pinned-legacy-plan-fallback",
                        "observed": false, "provider_version": null,
                        "plan_pin": "2.1.226" },
  "audit_occurrence_id": "…", "audit_candidate_digest": "…",
  "native_session_id": "…", "evidence_sha256": "…",
  "parser_key": "…", "attachment": { "…": "…" },
  "task_bytes_submitted": false
}
```

`status` is one of `migrated`, `already-known`, `identity-still-missing`
(Kimi pristine panel — no synthetic turn, no session fabricated), or
`refused`/`errored` with the same HTTP mapping rules as the repair route
(the refusal `reason` vocabulary adds `operation-conflict`,
`producer-disabled`, `candidate-drift`, `provider-drift`,
`generation-mismatch`, `occurrence-mismatch`, `seam-drift`,
`repair-attempt-ambiguous`, `repair-attempt-unresolved`, `in-progress`,
and `missing-agent`).

### GET /roster/provider-capabilities

**Read-scoped.**  The versioned truthful provider capability read
(cond-0377D): one cell per provider (`claude_code`, `codex`,
`kimi_cli`, `muse_cli`).  DeepSeek/Z.ai are Claude Code route provenance,
not separate harness identity domains.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "schema": "cao-m3-provider-capabilities-v1",
  "generated_at": "…",
  "route_provenance_note": "deepseek and zai run Claude Code with route provenance; …",
  "providers": [
    {
      "provider": "claude_code",
      "harness_domain": "claude_code",
      "route_provenance_domains": ["deepseek", "zai"],
      "build_identity": {
        "installed_build": {
          "banner": "Claude Code 2.1.226",
          "normalized": "2.1.226",
          "sha256": "…",
          "executable_path": "/opt/claude-code/claude"
        },
        "installed_build_source": "canary-receipt"
      },
      "parser_support": {
        "code_supported": true, "parser_key": "claude-modal-v1",
        "capability_schema": "cao-native-status-repair-v1",
        "supported_builds": ["2.1.226"], "escape": true
      },
      "status_observation_repair_code_supported": true,
      "canary": {
        "present": true, "state": "matching|stale|failed|absent",
        "build": "2.1.226", "operation_id": "…",
        "migration_operation_id": "…",
        "evidence_sha256": "…", "native_session_id": "…",
        "status_action_count": 1, "parser_key": "claude-modal-v1",
        "attachment_outcome": "attached", "recorded_at": "…"
      },
      "installed_live_repair_proven": true,
      "cell_state": "enabled",
      "reason": "…"
    }
  ]
}
```

- `cell_state` is `enabled`, `disabled`, `unsupported`, `unavailable`, or
  `unresolved` with a closed `reason`.  A cell is `enabled` ONLY with
  code support AND an installed live canary receipt DERIVED from the
  actual committed records (migration operation/request, deterministic
  repair operation, observation-attempt journal with exactly one status
  action, repair evidence/request/evidence digest, provider/parser/plan,
  native identity, attachment/adoption outcome) AND a **read-time
  revalidation**: on every read the current canonical executable is
  re-hashed and its bounded `--version` banner re-observed, and both must
  exactly match the receipt (path, full banner including Muse `R`
  revision, normalized build, and service-computed SHA-256).  A deleted,
  replaced, or drifted executable is a typed stale/disabled cell — never
  green, never an exception.  Static parser support appears only under
  `parser_support.supported_builds` (there is no static
  `build_identity.durable_builds` field); `build_identity.installed_build`
  is null without an observed canary and carries the canonical
  `executable_path` when present.
- `build_identity.installed_build` is OBSERVED at receipt time, never
  caller-asserted: the record seam accepts a canonical absolute existing
  executable path, computes the SHA-256 of that exact file itself, and
  runs the bounded provider `--version` probe against it in the bounded
  child environment, retaining the complete banner — Muse's
  `0.1.0-R708.1` revision is never normalized away, and a future
  same-semver build with a different digest never inherits the proven
  build's identity.  The canonical path, banner, and observed digest are
  bound into the receipt's request digest: a changed path/banner/digest
  under the same canary id conflicts, and a build or file change before
  persistence refuses and leaves the cell non-green.  If a truthful exact
  executable cannot be resolved or rechecked, the cell stays
  absent/disabled/unresolved.
- Kimi without a session stays `unresolved`/`disabled` and receives no
  synthetic turn.


### GET /roster/pane-identity

**Read-scoped** (requires `cao:read`; write/admin also satisfy it).  The
bounded exact-live-pane identity resolution (cond-0377D M3-A read seam):
resolves one exact live tmux pane to its registered CAO terminal, unique
LIVE stable-agent incarnation, and stable agent/lineage identity — the
fork primitive the conductor's `conduct whoami` will consume.

**Query parameters** (the only two accepted; anything else is ignored):
- `pane_id` — the immutable tmux pane id.
- `server_socket_path` — the canonical identity of the tmux server the
  caller observed the pane on.

The service **re-observes** the pane (`pane_control_identity`) and its
server (`observe_pane_server_identity`) through the bounded tmux seams
and binds the canonical server identity plus the immutable
`pane_id`/`window_id`/`session_id` and positive `pane_pid` — never
session/window names.  A caller-supplied `TMUX_PANE`, `TMUX`,
`CAO_TERMINAL_ID`, window name, or terminal id can never override the
pane mapping, because the request accepts none of them.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "schema": "cao-m3-pane-identity-resolution-v1",
  "status": "resolved",
  "reason": null,
  "observed_at": "…",
  "pane": {
    "pane_id": "%7", "window_id": "@7", "session_id": "$1",
    "pane_pid": 4242, "server_socket_path": "/private/tmp/cao-native.sock"
  },
  "terminal": {
    "terminal_id": "a1b2c3d4", "generation": null,
    "physical_occurrence": "00000000-0000-4000-8000-0000000000aa",
    "vintage": "legacy"
  },
  "incarnation": {
    "incarnation_id": "…", "disposition": "bound", "lineage_id": "…"
  },
  "agent": {
    "agent_id": "…", "lineage_id": "…", "harness": "claude_code",
    "native_session_id": "…", "disposition": "live"
  }
}
```

`status` is `resolved` or one of the typed non-identity reasons
(all 200 — absence and ambiguity are normal typed answers, never guessed
identities; `pane`/`terminal`/`incarnation`/`agent` are `null` for
non-identity):

- `pane-unreadable-or-dead` — the pane is not provably live on exactly
  the caller's canonical server (dead, unreadable, or on a different
  server: identical pane ids on two isolated servers never cross-resolve).
- `pane-unregistered` — live and on the right server, but no terminal row
  claims this pane id on this server.
- `terminal-pane-mismatch-or-superseded` — the registered row's exact
  tuple no longer matches (pane id reused with a changed
  window/session/pid), the row is superseded/dead, or multiple rows claim
  the exact tuple.
- `roster-incarnation-missing` — no roster incarnation, or the
  incarnation is retired/non-live: a stopped/dead or superseded
  incarnation cannot resolve even if historical records remain.
- `roster-incarnation-ambiguous-or-invalid` — two live incarnations share
  the terminal (ambiguous; never picks the first), the incarnation's
  pane/pid or the agent's current pointers disagree, or the roster/agent
  store is unreadable.

The lookup is **byte-for-byte read-only** (no terminal liveness, roster,
attachment, or journal mutation; no write lease is taken to perform a
read), every tmux subprocess is bounded through the existing timeout
mechanism, and the trust boundary is explicitly **cooperative-local
routing, not a security gate**: it does not authenticate the human or
process that asked the question, and it issues no credentials, tokens, or
approvals.


## Error Responses

All endpoints return standard HTTP status codes:

- `200 OK`: Success
- `201 Created`: Resource created
- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid parameters
- `404 Not Found`: Resource not found
- `409 Conflict`: Immutable identity conflict, admission refused, or an
  ambiguous terminal-only roster lookup
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Server error
- `503 Service Unavailable`: The roster/attachment store could not be read

Error response format:
```json
{
  "detail": "Error message"
}
```

**Exception:** the write-scoped
`POST /roster/terminals/{terminal_id}/native-identity-repair` route
returns its **typed outcome dict as the body** for every outcome —
including refusals and errors — instead of the generic `{"detail": ...}`
envelope, so a caller branches on the typed `status`/`reason` fields
without re-deciding what happened.  It never leaks raw pane output, raw
exceptions, or evidence from another operation.
