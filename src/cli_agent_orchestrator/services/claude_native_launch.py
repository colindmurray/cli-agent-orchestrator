"""The two Claude argv forms a managed native session is allowed to use.

Claude's native identity is not discovered — it is *chosen*. A canonical
UUID is minted before any provider I/O and handed to the launch as
``--session-id <uuid>``, so the session's identity exists, and is
recorded, before the provider has done anything at all. Recovery then
names that same uuid with ``--resume <uuid>``.

This is the structural difference from the Kimi native path, which asks
its ACP transport to mint a session and reads the id back out of the
reply. There the id is a *result*; here it is an *input*. The
consequence worth naming: a Claude launch that dies before its first
turn still has a recorded identity, because the identity preceded the
launch rather than depending on it succeeding.

Two argv forms exist and nothing else is accepted:

    launch    claude --session-id <uuid> [profile args]
    recover   claude --resume     <uuid> [profile args]

Every recency-derived form is refused by construction — ``--continue``,
``--last``, ``-c``, ``--fork-session`` and the non-persistent modes. They
bind whichever session happens to be newest, which after any other
activity on the machine is a different session, and a resume bound to it
resumes somebody else's context. That refusal lives in
:mod:`provider_contracts` and is applied here so the argv builder cannot
produce a form its own validator would reject.

#: The flag that *assigns* an identity at launch. Its argument is
#: mandatory (``--session-id <uuid>``), so a missing value is a startup
#: error rather than a silent fallback.
LAUNCH_OPTION = "--session-id"

#: The flag that names an already-assigned identity. Read the installed
#: build's own help before trusting the shape of this one:
#:
#:     -r, --resume [value]   Resume a conversation by session ID, or
#:                            open interactive picker with optional
#:                            search term
#:
#: The value is **optional**. A resume that loses its id therefore does
#: not fail — it opens an interactive picker and waits, which in a managed
#: pane is a provider sitting at a menu that nobody will ever answer,
#: indistinguishable from a slow start. Every argv built here carries the
#: value, and every check below confirms the value is actually present
#: rather than merely confirming the flag is.
RESUME_OPTION = "--resume"

#: ``-r`` is the same option. Recognised for *detection* so a second
#: identity option cannot slip through spelled differently, while only
#: the long form is ever emitted.
RESUME_OPTION_ALIASES = (RESUME_OPTION, "-r")

#: Options that would defeat the exact-identity binding, whatever else the
#: argv says. Held here as well as in the resume validator because this
#: module builds argv for the *launch* too, and a launch is not validated
#: by the resume contract.
#:
#: ``--from-pr`` joins the recency forms for the same reason they are
#: there: it resolves a session indirectly (by pull request, or by an
#: interactive picker) rather than naming one, so what it binds is not
#: decided by this argv.

#:                       'sonnet') or a model's full name (e.g.
#:                       'claude-fable-5').
#:
#: A launch that omits it runs on whatever the provider would choose,
#: which is how a session requested as sonnet came up as a 1M Opus route.
#: The request is not a preference the launch may round: an unpinnable
#: model is refused before any I/O rather than approximated.
MODEL_OPTION = "--model"

#: Accepted ``--model`` values, exactly. Two forms, because the provider
#: documents two and they mean different things:
#:
#: * an **alias** names *the latest model in a family*. Pinning an alias
#:   to one exact resolved id would encode a "latest" that the provider
#:   changes without telling us, so an alias request is satisfied by any
#:   observed id in that family — and by nothing outside it.
#: * a **full name** names one model. It is satisfied by exactly itself.
#:
#: Anything else is refused rather than passed through: a value this side
#: cannot check the observation against is a value it cannot honestly
#: attest, and passing it would put the route back in the state where
#: nobody could say what was running.
MODEL_ALIASES = ("opus", "sonnet", "haiku", "fable")

#: The family tokens a full model name may name. Read off the ids this
#: machine's provider has actually reported, never guessed:
#: ``claude-opus-5[1m]`` from a live SessionStart, plus ``claude-opus-5``,
#: ``claude-sonnet-5``, ``claude-sonnet-4-6``, ``claude-fable-5`` and

MODEL_FAMILIES = MODEL_ALIASES

#: Provider observations may carry a context-window suffix — the live proof
#: read ``claude-opus-5[1m]``. A request without a suffix selects only the
#: model, so the observed suffix is ignored. A request that explicitly carries
#: a suffix selects both model and context window, so the observation must
