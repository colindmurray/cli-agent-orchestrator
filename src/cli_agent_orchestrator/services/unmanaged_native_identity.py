"""Pre-task harness-native identity for the ordinary/new-terminal path.

Every newly launched unmanaged supervisor/worker on Claude Code
or Codex must obtain a deterministic harness-native session id BEFORE any
real task prompt/input is admitted, and the full-screen TUI must start by
resuming/attaching that exact id.  The managed-v2 path already does this;
the ordinary ``create_terminal`` path used to record ``identity_missing``
and stay ungated.

This module is the shared pre-task identity seam: it reuses the accepted
managed-v2 bootstrap primitives from the ordinary launch path — the
caller-chosen Claude id and the Codex zero-turn app-server bootstrap —
without adding a new claim phase or a parallel identity store.  The
stable-agent roster and the native-attachment authority remain the only
identity authorities.

Truth rules:

- One canonical effective working directory is resolved once and consumed
  by BOTH the physical pane launch and the native bootstrap, so the resumed
  TUI and the minted session agree byte-for-byte on cwd.
- Codex's route (model and ``model_reasoning_effort``) is derived from the
  loaded profile with the documented precedence — an explicit expected
  model/effort wins, then the profile's ``codexConfig`` overrides
  (``codexConfig.model`` / ``codexConfig.model_reasoning_effort``) win over
  the bare ``profile.model`` field — the same composed profile/route
  material the resumed TUI consumes.  An omitted route stays omitted until
  Codex reports the actual route; no placeholder route string is invented.
- For an activated cell, the contract is fail-closed: an unresolvable
  executable, an unproven build, or a refused bootstrap raises
  :class:`UnmanagedIdentityUnavailable`, and the launch fails before
  provider initialization or task input.  Best-effort legacy
  ``identity_missing`` remains only for providers outside this PR's
  activated set and for pre-existing legacy rows owned by the later repair
  slice.

Kimi is deliberately NOT activated here: installed Kimi 0.34.0 cannot bind
a CAO profile through the zero-turn ACP route (``session/new`` accepts only
cwd, additional directories, and ephemeral MCP servers; ``--agent-file``
plus ``--session`` is refused because the agent is bound at session
creation), and the only public profile-capable bootstrap necessarily
performs a real paid model turn.  That cell stays truthfully unactivated
pending the product decision.

    """Resolve the deterministic harness-native session id for an unmanaged
    new launch, BEFORE the provider starts.

    ``codex_profile_material`` is the EXACT material ``create_terminal``
    resolved once from the already-loaded profile (developer instructions,
    resolved MCP servers, tool policy) — the same core args the resumed TUI
    consumes; it is never reloaded here.  ``forwarded_environment`` is the
    effective env overlay the pane received (operator ``env_vars`` + persisted
    session env, merged with the backend's new/existing semantics), so the
    bootstrap subprocess and the pane agree byte-for-byte on the environment.

    Returns a bounded evidence record:

    ``native_session_id``   the exact id the TUI must resume/attach
    ``acquisition_method``  how the id came to exist (chosen / bootstrap)
    ``working_directory``   the one canonical cwd the pane AND bootstrap use
    ``model`` / ``effort``  the route the resumed TUI pins (actual for Codex:
                            the model the provider returned, and the effort
                            only when it reported one; never invented)
    ``bootstrap``           bounded provider-native bootstrap evidence

    Raises :class:`UnmanagedIdentityUnavailable` when the activated cell
    cannot supply its accepted contract — the launch fails closed.
