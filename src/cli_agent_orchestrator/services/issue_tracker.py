"""Project-scoped issue tracking.

A project is a *declared* grouping: one name, any number of directories,
sessions and git remotes, one issue log. That shape is the whole point — the
CAO system spans two repositories (``cao-conductor`` and
``cli-agent-orchestrator``) plus their worktrees plus a rotating cast of tmux
sessions, and its defects belong to one list rather than to whichever checkout
happened to notice them.

Resolution is deliberately ordered and deliberately strict:

    explicit project id  ->  session name  ->  path  ->  git remote

Explicit wins because a caller that names a project has already answered the
question. Session beats path because a supervisor and its workers share a
session while working across several directories. Path beats git remote
because a worktree is a directory fact before it is a remote fact. And an
identifier resolving to two projects is refused at *registration* time rather
than resolved by row order at read time: a scope that silently picks one of
two issue logs is worse than no scope, because the filing appears to succeed.

Nothing here reads or writes ``ProjectAliasModel``. That table is the memory
subsystem's automatic identity cache; grouping two repos under one issue log
must not merge their memory recall as a side effect.

    Only fields the caller actually passed are touched, and a field whose new
    value equals the old one writes no event — an audit trail full of no-ops is
    an audit trail nobody reads.

    ``expected_updated_at`` is an optimistic-concurrency precondition for
    callers that read then write (a wayfinder session rewriting a map body):
    when given, the update applies only if the issue's ``updated_at`` still
    equals it, and a mismatch refuses THIS write with a conflict carrying the
    current observable version. Callers that do not pass it get the historical
    unconditional edit.

    The precondition is enforced at the write seam, not by a Python comparison
    before it: every persisting update is applied by ONE conditional UPDATE
    guarded on the ``updated_at`` this transaction read. SQLite serialises
    writers, so a concurrent commit turns the guard into a no-match instead of
    a lost update — with ``expected_updated_at`` the loser gets the typed
    conflict; without it the update is retried against the fresh row (a label
    delta re-merges, so two cooperative add-label edits both land). A failed or
    superseded attempt writes nothing and records no events: the audit trail
    only ever records the transition that was actually established.

    The positional parameter is ``issue_key`` rather than ``key`` so that
    ``update_issue(k, key=...)`` reports the intended "not editable" refusal
    instead of a TypeError about duplicate arguments.
