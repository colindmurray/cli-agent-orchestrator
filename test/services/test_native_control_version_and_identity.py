"""Native control: the version the binding records, and the mode it really is.

Two defects from one fresh installed acceptance. Bind and readiness both
proved, then initial admission refused with ``composer_newline_unproven``
and zero task bytes; and the same generation could not have been reached by
control input even if admission had succeeded.

1. The durable binding records the provider banner verbatim --
   ``2.1.220 (Claude Code)``, which is what the provider printed -- while
   the composer pin table is keyed by the bare build ``2.1.220`` and the
   adapters looked it up with a raw ``.strip()``. An installed, pinned,
   proven build was therefore refused as unproven. The bind-time version
   pin passed on the same string, because it normalizes.

2. ``resolve_control_identity`` classified every managed reservation as
   ``acp`` with both identities null, so a managed native pane was refused
   by the generic path and unreachable by control input at all.

Both are asserted from the durable value rather than a convenient one: the
banner here is the exact string the binding stores.
