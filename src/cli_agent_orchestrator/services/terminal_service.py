"""Terminal service with workflow functions.

This module provides high-level terminal management operations that orchestrate
multiple components (database, tmux, providers) to create a unified terminal
abstraction for CLI agents.

Key Responsibilities:
- Terminal lifecycle management (create, get, delete)
- Provider initialization and cleanup
- Tmux session/window management
- Terminal output capture and message extraction

Terminal Workflow:
1. create_terminal() → Creates tmux window, initializes provider, starts logging
2. send_input() → Sends user message to the agent via tmux
3. get_output() → Retrieves agent response from terminal history
4. delete_terminal() → Cleans up provider, database record, and logging

    The insert above already wrote the tuple, so on a first launch this

    makes the registration path the one both a new launch and a later
    re-drive go through, so idempotency by ``(terminal_id, generation)``
    and the refusal to re-point are exercised by ordinary use rather than
    being guarantees nothing ever tests.

    Dispatches on vintage, because a v2 managed terminal lives only in the
    v2 store. Sending it to the legacy writer asked ``terminals`` for a row
    only ``managed_launch_v2_terminals`` holds, which reported an absent
    row for *every* native launch — a false negative from a table the
    launch never wrote.

    The two vintages differ in what a failure means, and so in what this
    does about it:

    v1 logs and continues, unchanged. The row is already correct there, so
    this call can only confirm it, and tearing down a working terminal over
    a redundant write would be the worse error.

    v2 raises. For a native launch the registration is a *precondition*,
    not bookkeeping: the identity registered here is what every later
    identity-addressed operation resolves against, so a launch that
    proceeds without it produces exactly what was observed in production —
    a live pane whose terminal nothing can find, status stuck unknown, and
    a lookup failure repeating for as long as the pane lives.

    Raising does not tear that pane down. A managed v2 launch runs under
    ``preserve_on_init_failure``, so this refusal preserves the generation
    and exposes it as a zero-byte failure -- one that can then be finalized
    negative, because no binding, bind intent or admission was ever
    published. So the choice is not between a live pane and a dead one: it
    is between a preserved generation somebody can close and a live pane
    that can be neither addressed nor cleaned up. This happens before any
    task byte can be delivered, and is the only reason this function is

    The build deployed before this one recorded ``pane_id``, ``window_id``

    0. (new sessions only) Preflight: strictly pre-clear any stale persisted
       session env BEFORE any resource exists — a failure aborts with zero
       cleanup actions
    1. Generate unique terminal ID and window name
    2. Create tmux session/window (new or existing)
    3. Save terminal metadata to database
    4. Initialize the CLI provider (starts the agent)
    5. Set up terminal logging via tmux pipe-pane

    Args:
        provider: Provider type string (e.g., "kiro_cli", "claude_code")
        agent_profile: Name of the agent profile to use
        session_name: Optional custom session name. If not provided, auto-generated.
        new_session: If True, creates a new tmux session. If False, adds to existing.
        working_directory: Optional working directory for the terminal shell
        env_vars: Operator-forwarded env vars (``cao launch --env``). On
            ``new_session=True``, these are stored on the session record and
            inherited by every worker spawned later in the same session. On
            ``new_session=False``, the persisted session vars are merged in
            automatically and the explicit ``env_vars`` argument is merged on
            top, winning on key conflict — per-step vars (e.g. workflow
            routing ids) must reach the window even inside an existing
            session. See issues #248 and #408.
        caller_id: Terminal ID of the supervisor that created this terminal
            via handoff/assign. Recorded so send_message can route callbacks
            structurally instead of parsing IDs out of message text (issue #284).
            None for operator-launched terminals.

    A dashboard wheel-scroll can leave the pane in copy mode, where the
    payload's Enter is consumed by the mode and the text rests unsubmitted
    while every transport fact reads success.  Detection that cannot be
    proven is a zero-byte refusal, never a speculative cancel and never a
    delivery claim; the cancel is never sent speculatively either.

    Raises:
        TerminalInputRefusedError: the pane lease was busy or the copy-mode
            guard refused.  Both are proven zero-payload-byte outcomes
            raised BEFORE the status arm and buffer clear, so a refused
            write leaves detection exactly as it found it and may be
            re-attempted.  ``reason_code`` uses the control-input
            contract's closed vocabulary (``copy-mode-active`` for the
            guard's own refusals, ``pane-busy`` for the lease).
        Exception: anything the payload write itself raises propagates
            unchanged — bytes may have landed, so the write is ambiguous
            and is never silently re-typed.

    fires. For each DB terminal whose tmux window still exists, recreate the

    skipped (stale rows; deletion is left to normal lifecycle paths).

    Every row is proven through the same identity boundary a control write
    uses, before anything is piped or typed. This runs at server startup,
    against rows written by a *previous* process, which is precisely when
    the recorded names are least trustworthy: a session and window torn
    down while the server was dead and recreated under the same names
    resolve perfectly, so the unverified form both nudged Enter into a
    stranger's pane and piped that stranger's output into this row's FIFO
    — mislabelled as this terminal's, and read as its provider status
    from then on. A row whose proof fails is skipped with zero bytes

    sessions torn down while the server was dead leave ``session_env`` rows

    env. Live-session rows are retained so windows created post-restart still
    receive the persisted env (issue #248 durability). Rows are recorded as
    removed only after their durable deletion is confirmed; failed deletions
    are retained and reported under ``failed`` (cond-0050).

    A **deliberately stopped** session is exempt. Its tmux session is gone
    by definition — that is what stopping means — so the existence probe
    alone would delete the forwarded env of every hibernated session at the
    next boot. The failure is silent, delayed, and surfaces much later as
    "resume worked but every worker is on the wrong binary", which is close
    to undiagnosable from the symptom.
