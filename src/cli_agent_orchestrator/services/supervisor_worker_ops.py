"""Supervisor-owned worker retire, resume, and lost-pane recovery (M3-D).

Three acts a supervisor performs on one of its own workers, and the reason
each one lives here rather than in the fork substrates it calls:

``retire_worker_pane``
    Ending a worker is a *task* decision before it is a pane decision. The
    occurrence is finalized first, so the round's evidence is preserved
    write-once, and only then is the incarnation retired and the pane
    collected. Doing it the other way round loses the report at exactly the
    moment somebody needs it.

``resume_worker``
    Exact same-native-session restoration through M3-B, and nothing else. A
    worker M3-B refuses is ``failed``; it is never quietly relaunched fresh,
    because the whole value of an exact resume is that the transcript is the
    same transcript, and a silent downgrade would give the supervisor a worker
    that looks continuous and is not.

``recover_lost_pane``
    The pane is gone and the supervisor has to decide what replaces it. Three
    outcomes, and the third is the important one:

    * exact restoration if CAO still holds the identity;
    * a fresh fallback **only** with the supervisor summary, the digest-bound
      artifacts, and an explicit ``complete`` seed quality behind it;
    * otherwise the worker stays **paused for reconciliation** — no fresh
      pane, no replayed input, no reconstructed instruction.

    A truncated seed is not a small problem: it reads as context while missing
    the part that mattered, so a fresh worker started on it continues
    confidently from the wrong place. Guessing at a lost worker's task, or
    replaying the input it was last sent, is worse than pausing — the pause is
    visible and recoverable, and the guess is neither.
