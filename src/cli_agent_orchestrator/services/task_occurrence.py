"""The durable task/round occurrence seam (cond-0380 M3-D).

M3-D is the sole authority for what a *task* is. Everything below it —
M3-A's stable agents and incarnations, M3-B's exact reincarnations, M3-C's
cohort receipts and wake requests — deals in physical effects, and this module
consumes those only as opaque evidence. It never creates a second physical
roster and never reinterprets what a fork effect did.

Four rules shape the schema, and each of them is a bug that has a name:

**A terminal generation is not a task id, and neither is a native
conversation.** Both name a disposable physical effect. A stable agent
outlives many of each, and an exact reincarnation deliberately keeps the same
native conversation across a new generation. Using either as the task identity
means a resumed pane silently inherits the previous round's task, or a report
that arrives after a restore is attributed to the wrong occurrence. The
occurrence id is minted here and carries the exact effect-incarnation
reference *alongside* it, so a reader can still say which physical effect
produced which evidence.

**Stable-agent reuse must never reopen a finalized occurrence.** A stable
agent is precisely the thing that survives a pane, so "the same agent is back"
is the most likely way a finished task gets re-run. One partial unique index —
``agent_id`` where ``state = 'open'`` — makes at most one occurrence open per
agent, and a finalized row is outside that index, so reuse opens a *new*
occurrence rather than reviving a closed one. ``open_occurrence`` refuses the
finalized id explicitly rather than letting the caller discover it as an
integrity error.

**Current and finalized are separate.** A supervisor keeps revising an open
occurrence's boundary evidence and its summary/artifact seed as the round
progresses; finalizing copies the accepted values into a write-once family. If
they shared columns, a late current update would rewrite what a finished
occurrence reported — and that is exactly the update a crashed-then-retried
worker sends.

**Unknown extensions are preserved, not interpreted and not redispatched.**
An extension carries an opaque versioned payload and names its decider. A
build that does not recognise the kind — including a future build's
completion claim — keeps it verbatim and routes it to that decider. Turning an
undecided extension back into a dispatch would replay work whose owner has not
ruled on it; treating a future completion claim as completion would finalize
an occurrence on evidence this build cannot read.

What this module stores is references and digests: occurrence ids, incarnation
ids, SHA-256 digests of reports/checkpoints/summaries/artifacts, and bounded
artifact *references*. It stores no task text, no provider output, no
environment values, and no secrets.
