"""The one path that types a control into a provider's composer.

This is the service behind ``POST /terminals/{id}/control-input``.  It
exists because the ordinary delivery path cannot make the promise a
control needs: that the exact characters the operator wrote reached
exactly one pane, exactly once, or that the caller was told truthfully
that it did not.

Everything here is arranged around one ordering, and the order is the
guarantee rather than an implementation detail:

1. Screen the payload.  Nothing that could synthesise its own escape
   sequence or submit at a point the caller did not choose gets past
   this step, and nothing has been written when it fails.
2. Resolve the server's own view of the terminal's identity, then
   compare it with the caller's declared expectation.  A caller that
   expected a different pane, generation, or provider is refused here —
   before the journal, before the lease, before any byte.
3. Open the durable intent.  From this point a lost response has an
   answer, because the record exists whether or not the caller ever sees
   the reply.
4. Take the pane lease, and re-verify the physical identity *under* it.
   The gap between "checked" and "wrote" is where a pane that died and
   was replaced would otherwise let a control land in a stranger's
   composer, and the lease is what makes the re-check meaningful.
5. Claim the write, then write.  The claim commits first, so a crash
   afterwards is durably visible as "may have been written" instead of
   being silently indistinguishable from "never started".

The refusals are typed and the vocabulary is closed, so a caller never
has to infer intent from prose.  A refusal — and only a refusal — proves
zero bytes reached the pane and licenses another attempt.

What this path deliberately does not do: fall back.  There is no
degradation to a tmux buffer paste, no raw key injection, no second
endpoint to try.  A control the operator believes was delivered once
must never be delivered twice or as different bytes, and every fallback
is a way for that to happen quietly.

Managed provider sessions are refused rather than typed into.  Their
panes run a bridge process, not a composer; the zero-keystroke contract
that governs them is not something this path is entitled to bypass, and
their control surface is the generation-bound managed operations API.

            half of a control.
        expected_identity: What the caller believes it is addressing.  Any

        request_digest: The caller's own digest of this request.  When

        lease_timeout: Seconds to wait for the pane lease.  The default
