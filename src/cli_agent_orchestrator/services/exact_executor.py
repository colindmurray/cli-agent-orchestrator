"""The dark exact physical executor for same-native-session reincarnation
(cond-0378 B3).

B3 is the one place the accepted M3-B physical sequence actually happens.
It consumes the exact B1 restore contract and the B2 winning operation /
effect-intent / barrier seam, and performs — for one dormant stable
agent — the single physical reincarnation:

1. claim/adopt the winning B2 operation, then durably reserve exactly one
   successor terminal id and fresh generation BEFORE any physical I/O;
2. ``fence_prior``: establish that the retired prior incarnation is the
   exact fenced source (retired, current, dormant);
3. ``reap_prior``: tear down only that exact prior terminal generation/
   pane/process when present, through the exact-generation teardown seam
   with the attachment release and roster retirement HELD for B3's own
   authorized steps — a reused terminal id or a replacement generation
   preserves the replacement and refuses;
4. ``release_attachment``: reconcile/release the prior native attachment
   only after the authoritative no-survivor proof; a positively live or
   unobservable competing owner refuses rather than double-attaches;
5. ``acquire_native``/``create_pane``/``launch_resume``/``verify_identity``:
   acquire the SAME harness-scoped native session id for the reserved
   successor and launch the same harness through
   ``native_tui_launch.start(..., launch_kind="resume")`` — never a fresh
   launch, never ``managed_launch_v2.attempt_resume``, never a shell
   send-keys path, never an alternative provider binder.  The launch's
   optional authorize callback is the pre-effect linearization point for
   each of those ordered intents; because pane creation atomically starts
   the resume argv, the ``create_pane`` and ``launch_resume`` intents are
   authorized back-to-back immediately before the single atomic transport
   call — a barrier landing between them creates no pane;
6. append/bind the fresh incarnation to the EXISTING stable agent and
   native lineage with disposition ``bound`` in the same database
   transaction that rechecks the operation phase, lifecycle epoch,
   barrier, and exact dormant source — then record the durable accepted
   result.

The successor is never task-admitted and zero original task/input bytes
are sent: B3 stops at ``verify_identity``; ``admit_input`` belongs to
M3-D/M3-F.  Exact restoration preserves the actual harness and native
session; a model/effort/route/mode/provider-version variation — or launch
material selecting profile/provider-home material other than the
contract's recorded mapping — is allowed only when the operation names the
exact bounded compatibility-cell ref/digest for this harness and the
launch material agrees with it; B3 records/consumes that fact, it never
infers that a cell passes (B4 owns installed canaries, M3-F owns
activation).  An absent/unproven/mismatched required cell or a missing
required B1 launch fact is a typed disabled/refused outcome BEFORE any
physical effect.  The effective requested-or-stored model/effort is
computed once and pinned provider-aware on the resume argv/environment
itself AND the managed terminal metadata; a pin-requiring harness with an
unknown or unpinnable effective model disables exact restore rather than
falling back to the provider's ambient default — except that a
cell-covered route the harness's own validator cannot attest (a
DeepSeek/GLM-style route through the claude_code harness) may pin the
effective model through the material's explicit, precedence-checked route
args/environment.  The identity-proof version selector is the contract's
recorded executable version unless the material's hint enters the
variation gate.  The selected profile/provider-home mappings are verified
live (paired ``_path``/``_sha256`` files re-hashed) and then APPLIED to
the launch through provider-appropriate explicit lanes (claude_code
``--settings <path>``; ``provider_home_path`` → the harness's home carrier
env) or the material's sealed profile args/environment — validated to
reference exactly the selected paths — so the resumed harness loads the
verified bytes, never an ambient HOME/default profile; a selected
reference with no safe lane and no sealed application is typed-disabled
before effects.  The stored trusted project root is validated before
effects (canonical real directory, Codex only), applied to the Codex
resume argv through its canonical invocation-only trust override, and
passed exactly to managed terminal creation.

Outcomes are durable and bounded: response loss and restart return the
same successor terminal id/generation and the recorded outcome —
``accepted`` and ``reconciliation-required`` are write-once final, so an
ambiguous physical result is never hidden by a later call.  Stop remains
a hard boundary: an effect intent that committed just before the barrier
stays recorded for M3-C drain/force-reap; a barrier that won first
admits no later effect; a barrier that lands while launch/verification
is already in flight records the observed resource, rechecks the gate
transactionally before the roster bind, and returns
reconciliation-required without binding or admitting anything.  Only the
operator resumes a stopped campaign.

No lock — Python, file, or database — is ever held over provider or tmux
I/O: every journal/reservation/result call commits a short transaction
and returns before the physical act it authorized.
