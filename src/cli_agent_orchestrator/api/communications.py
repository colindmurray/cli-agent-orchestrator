"""Bounded HTTP surface for the conductor's communications catalog (design §7).

This router is deliberately separate from ``api/main.py`` so that the only
merge collision with live lanes is one import line and one
``include_router`` call.

The three endpoints read the conductor's published projection:

* ``GET /communications`` — metadata list, never bodies;
* ``GET /communications/{communication_id}`` — one communication with body content;
* ``GET /communications/attachments/{attachment_id}`` — one attachment with content.

All responses carry ``Cache-Control: no-store``.  The service never
accepts a ``path``, ``root``, or ``project_dir`` parameter, never turns an
identifier into a filename, and verifies digests before serving bytes.
