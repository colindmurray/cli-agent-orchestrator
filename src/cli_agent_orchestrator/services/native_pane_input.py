"""Literal input into one exact provider pane, and a live read of its turn state.

A native TUI has no control socket. The only way to give it a task is to
type into the pane it runs in, which makes *which pane* and *what exactly
was typed* the two facts everything else rests on.

Both are addressed the same way: by the immutable tmux pane id (``%N``)
rather than a session/window name. A name is a label that can be reused,
renamed, or resolved to a different pane after a window closes -- and
tmux answers a request for a missing window by acting on some *other*
pane with exit status 0, so a name-targeted write can land in a stranger's
terminal and report success. The pane id is minted once per pane and is
never reused while the server lives, so a write targeted at one either
reaches that pane or fails.

The writing side is deliberately split by effect. ``send_literal`` writes
payload text and never submits; ``send_enter`` submits and writes no
payload; ``send_key`` sends one named control key. A single
``send(text)`` would let a newline inside a payload do the submitting,
which is how a half-composed message becomes a sent one.

The guarantee this module makes is about *payload writes*, and only
those: a literal write never contains CR, LF, or a bracketed-paste
marker. ``tmux send-keys -l`` writes its argument as literal characters
with no key-name interpretation and no paste buffer, so nothing in a
message can be reinterpreted as a control action.

``send_key`` carries no such guarantee, and must not be read as if it
did. A tmux key name is *resolved to bytes by tmux*, and those bytes are
then interpreted by the provider: ``C-j`` emits LF, and ``Enter`` submits
by design. Whether a given key inserts a newline rather than sending is a
fact about one provider build, so **the caller owns that meaning** by
pinning the key to an exact version. This module only guarantees it sends
the key it was given, to the pane it was given, or raises.

Multi-line content is delivered on those terms: each line is typed as a
literal payload write, and the breaks between lines are named keys chosen
by the version-pinned caller.

      content (the emptiness determination on the final capture): the
      command provably never submitted.
    - ``unknown`` — no classification could be made (every capture failed,
      or the text left the composer without the signal appearing).  Never
      read as "probably executed".
