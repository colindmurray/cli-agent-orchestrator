"""Dark COND-0230 M10 route observe/close/result transaction core.

This is the fork-owned operation journal underneath a future provider-effect
route lane, and deliberately nothing else. The capability is **dark**:
``enabled()`` is always ``False``, no provider surface is observed, no pane
input or ``Escape`` is issued, no consumer, route, or CLI is attached, and no
wake is ever delivered or reconciled. What exists here is the record that has
to be right *before* anything is allowed to act, because once an effect lane is
attached it is this journal it obeys.

One operation id and one deterministic canonical request digest are bound to
the exact target tuple (target terminal id + generation, native session id,
provider, provider version, provider artifact SHA-256) and the exact requester
(requester terminal id + generation).

Before any provider effect exists, the same row also journals the four ordered
stage facts a future effect lane must durably commit: the pre-probe intent,
the provider-surface observation, the pre-close intent, and the close proof.
Each is one bounded canonical JSON object; progress is derived from
nullability and ordering. The one probe/close authorization each intent's
first exact CAS grants is never re-issued on retry, and a positive
``observed-closed`` receipt is derived inside the terminal transaction from
the already-persisted observation and close proof — never from a
caller-supplied proof copy.

Two guarantees, and the failure each one prevents:

**Exact replay, divergent refusal.** A retry under the same operation id
re-reads the stored record, never a second row and never a re-decision. A
retry whose canonical bytes differ from the stored request is refused before
any mutation, so one operation id cannot be reused to smuggle a different
target or requester into an already-journaled operation.

**One nonterminal owner per exact target tuple.** At most one operation holds a
target as ``requested``; the partial unique index in the schema is the durable
form of that. A different operation id that loses the tuple is itself stored as
an immutable ``zero-effect-refusal`` (terminal, no provider effect, no receipt,
its own requester still woken) with the winning operation id kept only as
non-authoritative ``detail``. Response loss is recovered by re-reading the same
operation id; an ambiguous stored result is never re-driven into a second
effect.

The terminal transaction is atomic: the immutable closed-vocabulary result, the
canonical final event and its digest, the optional positive
``cao-route-observation-receipt-v1``, and one deterministic wake claim in the
existing inbox table (``expected_receiver_generation`` pinned to the captured
requester generation) commit together or not at all. The only extra row at
terminal commit is that inbox claim; there is no event, receipt, outbox, or
wake table.
