"""Durable, idempotent physical-reincarnation operation journal + the narrow
shared per-session effect seam (cond-0378 B2).

B2 is the retry/race integrity seam a later B3 executor and the later M3-C
Stop/Pause cohort consume.  It owns two things and nothing else:

- **The operation journal.**  ``claim_operation`` claims the winning
  operation for one exact source slot — stable agent, exact retired prior
  incarnation, lifecycle epoch, post-B1 roster revision — in one short
  database transaction, binding every immutable fact the M3-B design names:
  caller-minted operation id and canonical request digest, canonical session
  name, role/profile family, current lineage, harness and same-harness
  native session id, the exact B1 restore-contract id/digest/schema, and the
  requested route/provider/model/effort/execution-mode facts plus a bounded
  compatibility-cell reference/digest (recorded, never inferred as passing
  here).  An exact operation-id/request replay adopts; changed immutable
  input under one operation id conflicts; a concurrent different id for the
  same slot can never create a second winner — the loser observes a typed
  slot conflict naming the durable winner, which the query surface
  (``get_operation`` / ``get_operation_by_slot``) returns so response loss
  is resolved by GET/query/adoption, never a second POST/claim.

- **The shared session-effect seam.**  ``authorize_effect_intent``
  CAS-records the next physical effect intent only while the exact operation
  is the winner, the requested step is the EXACT next step after the current
  journal phase (skips, reversals, and concurrent out-of-order steps refuse),
  the caller's expected phase matches the current phase, the session
  lifecycle is still the bound epoch and is not ``stopped``, the fork-owned
  session barrier has not been claimed by Stop, and the bound
  stable-agent/source/restore facts still agree with the operation.  Every
  later phase authorization rechecks the same facts.  An exact replay of an
  already-recorded intent — and an exact operation claim replay — adopts the
  durable truth FIRST, so response loss followed by Stop/lifecycle/roster
  drift converges instead of falsely conflicting.  One logical physical step
  has exactly one intent: a different effect id for an already-won step
  surfaces the durable winner through a typed conflict and
  ``get_effect_intent_by_step``.  ``claim_session_barrier`` /
  ``get_session_barrier`` expose the narrow durable barrier primitive M3-C
  will claim during Stop.  Effect-intent-wins-then-barrier preserves the
  in-flight intent for later M3-C reconciliation; barrier-wins-then-effect
  admits no later phase.  Barriers never expire and are never cleared
  automatically.

This journal/CAS is deliberately NOT a new abstract identity-claim ceremony:
native identity was already captured by M3-A, and B2 adds only the smallest
durable winner and effect-boundary state needed to prevent duplicate physical
actions after a good-faith retry, race, or response loss.  The supervisor's
ordinary authority to resurrect its own dormant or lost workers through the
later B3 primitive is preserved — no routine human gate, no credentials, no
hostile-local-process defenses.  Harness/model routing stays replaceable:
exact restoration preserves the actual harness/native session, while any
route/model/effort/mode variation remains a proven same-harness
capability-cell question rather than a hard-coded provider matrix.

B2 performs NO tmux, provider, native attachment, terminal creation, input,
Stop/Pause, conductor, or task/supervisor effect.  The effect ``steps`` this
module accepts are recorded intent labels with zero physical behavior; the
closed vocabulary mirrors the accepted M3-B physical sequence so B3 does not
invent names.  Never hold a Python lock, flock, database transaction, or SQL
row lock over future tmux/provider I/O: every call commits its short
transaction and returns the durable record BEFORE the caller performs any
physical I/O.

Storage: three additive ORM tables (``reincarnation_operations``,
``reincarnation_effect_intents``, ``session_effect_barriers``) created by
``clients/database.py`` (``create_all`` for fresh databases,
``_migrate_operation_journal`` for existing ones).  All mutation runs inside
one SQLite transaction; no file or database lock is ever held across
provider, tmux, or network I/O.

    boundary (the seam's gate).

    ``record`` is the full stored row dict from the read surface — the parsed
    request payload (``record["request"]``), the raw canonical JSON
    (``record["request_json"]``), and every duplicated indexed column.
    Verifies, before any mutation:

    1. complete shape — the stored payload decodes into a full typed
       ``OperationRequest`` through the same constructor used at claim time;
    2. canonical bytes — the stored JSON equals the decoded request's
       canonical serialization AND hashes to the stored digest, so a
       semantically valid but non-canonical representation (or a
       content/digest divergence) is refused;
    3. column consistency — every duplicated row column equals the decoded
       canonical payload, so an accidental column-only edit cannot produce
       contradictory reads;
    4. known phase — an unknown stored phase is a typed refusal, never a
       silent pass.

    Returns ``None`` only for a complete, canonical, digest-consistent record
    whose row and JSON agree.  Never raises on malformed input; every
    malformed/unknown/divergent shape maps to a typed reason.  This is
    bounded partial-write/schema-drift safety at the effect boundary, not a
    general corruption framework or hostile tamper protection.

    durable winner through a typed conflict and ``get_effect_intent_by_step``.

    A genuinely NEW intent must declare the journal phase it observed:
    ``expected_phase`` is mandatory and must equal the operation's current
    phase (the convenient first-step default is ``claimed``; every later step
    requires the exact prior step phase), and the requested step must be the
    exact next step after that phase.  The phase CAS is a checked one-winner
    transition performed first in the same short transaction — a lost CAS
    raises the typed conflict and no intent row survives.  The record is the
    linearization point, not a lock: the caller runs its tmux/provider effect
    after this call returns, and if the barrier is claimed in between, the
    intent stays preserved for M3-C to adopt/drain or force-reap.  ``db`` and
    race semantics follow ``claim_operation``.
